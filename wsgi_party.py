        All applications are locally bound in the same Python process, and this
        message passing occurs in a blocking synchronous call.  This provides
        each application a means to get information from each other application
        bound in the same process.

        We could just expose methods, but a message passing scheme is more
        generic.  I have no particular opinions about messaging, and here model
        message as a key-value tuple -- that is, an item in a dictionary.  The
        key is a message type, and the value is a pack of arguments to pass
        downstream -- a dumb protocol.  The response is a key-value tuple with
        the same message key (to keep symmetric send/receive code) and the
        return value of the implementation's handler.

        This is a poor man's RPC, but in a local process.  Being local, there
        is no concern for serialization.  Should we structure this with an
        existing RPC?  Make suggestions.

        If we are keeping scope to a single WSGI process and have no intention
        of using remote objects, the most straightforward design would be to
        use Python objects exposing methods, either e.g. Flask instances or a
        proxy object (which would expose only selected methods).
